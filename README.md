# hello-world

My name is Justin Legg!

I am an aspiring web developer with a passion for finding creative solutions to complex problems. 
I also enjoy building, maintaining and overclocking computers, more specifically gaming computers.
My goal is to become a master of full stack javascript, starting with the front end and React.
